# Building Your Local Garden

In an age where everything lives in the cloud, there's something radical about keeping your work local. This isn't about rejecting modern tools—it's about creating a space that's truly yours, independent of algorithms, tracking, and the constant pull of the network.

## Why Local Matters

When your work lives locally, you control it completely. There's no algorithm deciding what you see, no tracking of your every keystroke, no dependency on an internet connection to access your own thoughts. Your local environment becomes a sanctuary—a place where you can think, create, and work without interference.

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Choose Your Tools

Start with tools that respect your privacy and work offline:
- **Text Editors**: VS Code, Sublime Text, or Vim for code
- **Note-Taking**: Obsidian, LogSeq, or plain markdown files
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes locally
- **Task Management**: Plain text files or local-first apps

### 2. Organize Your Workspace

Create a clear structure:
```
~/workspace/
  ├── projects/
  ├── notes/
  ├── archives/
  └── resources/
```

### 3. Sync Strategically

If you need sync, use tools that give you control:
- **Git**: For code and version control
- **Syncthing**: For peer-to-peer file synchronization
- **Encrypted backups**: For important data

## The Benefits

A local-first approach gives you:
- **Speed**: No waiting for network requests
- **Privacy**: Your work stays yours
- **Reliability**: Works even when offline
- **Control**: You decide what to sync and when

## Building the Habit

Start small. Move one project local. See how it feels. Notice the difference in your focus, your sense of ownership, your connection to your work.

Your local garden is a place where you can think deeply, work without interruption, and create something that's truly yours. It's worth the effort to build it.
