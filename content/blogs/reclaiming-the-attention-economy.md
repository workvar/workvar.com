# Reclaiming the Attention Economy

We are living in an attention economy, and our attention is being harvested. Every notification, every recommendation, every "you might also like" is designed to keep us engaged, scrolling, consuming. But our attention doesn't belong to them—it belongs to us.

## The Harvest

The modern web is built on a simple model: capture attention, hold it as long as possible, monetize it. Every platform is optimized for engagement, not for our well-being. They're not trying to help us—they're trying to own us.

We've become the product, and our attention is the commodity being sold.

## The Rebellion

But we can choose differently. We can:
- **Block the noise**: Use tools that remove distractions
- **Choose our tools**: Support software that respects our attention
- **Create boundaries**: Define when and how we engage
- **Build our own spaces**: Create environments that serve us, not algorithms

## Taking Back Control

Reclaiming the attention economy starts with small acts:
1. Turn off notifications for non-essential apps
2. Use ad blockers and distraction removers
3. Choose tools that don't track you
4. Create focused work environments
5. Support developers who build for humans, not engagement

## The Future We're Building

We're building a different kind of software. One that:
- Respects your attention
- Doesn't track your behavior
- Helps you focus, not distract
- Gives you control, not takes it away

This is our declaration of independence. Our attention belongs to us, and we're taking it back.

Join us in the rebellion. Your focus is worth fighting for.
